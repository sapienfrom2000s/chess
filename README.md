This program uses normal chess notations except instead of using e4, use Pe4. For mating purposes just appending with '+' will do the job ie. Qe5+ instead of Qe5#. It detects the move pattern as Piece-origin(optional)-destination

*This project was my first attempt at building chess. I failed at it miserably. I rebuilt the project from scratch which is called rewrite-chess*
